# Base rules

The defaults every pattern in this skill builds on. When a project has no motion rules of its own, paste the block below into `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` or the editor rules file, so the numbers travel with the codebase instead of living in one conversation.

# Motion rules

Decide first whether the animation should exist.
- Animate to give feedback, to show where something came from or went, or to mark a state change. Otherwise do not animate.
- Do not animate actions a person repeats all day or triggers from the keyboard. They must feel instant.

## Timing
- Press and hover feedback: 100 to 150 ms.
- Small elements entering (tooltip, menu, toast): 150 to 250 ms.
- Dialogs and panels: 200 to 300 ms. Large surfaces: 300 to 400 ms.
- Exits are shorter than enters: about two thirds of the enter.
- Respond to a press within 100 ms, before any network result.

## Easing
- Entering, and anything the person started: ease-out. Default cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1).
- Leaving the screen: ease-in. Moving within the screen: ease-in-out.
- Linear only for colour, opacity or constant rotation.
- Use a spring for gestures and for anything that can be interrupted. Keep bounce between 0 and 0.3.
- Never overshoot opacity or colour.

## Space
- Scale from 0.9 or above, never from 0.
- Set transform-origin to the element that triggered the change.
- Stagger list items 20 to 60 ms apart and keep the whole sequence under 500 ms.

## Performance
- Animate transform, opacity, filter and clip-path. Do not animate width, height, top, left or margin.
- For auto height, animate grid-template-rows from 0fr to 1fr.
- No "transition: all". Use will-change only while an animation runs.
- Never start above-the-fold content at opacity 0: it delays the largest paint.

## Accessibility
- Under prefers-reduced-motion: reduce, replace movement with a short fade or an instant change. Keep the state change visible.
- Anything that moves on its own for more than 5 seconds needs a pause control.
- Motion is never the only signal. Pair it with text, an icon or colour.
```

Every pattern file is an instance of these rules: the feedback entries spend the press budget, the overlay entries follow the exit ratio, the gesture entries use the spring rule, and all of them carry a reduced-motion fallback.
